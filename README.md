# Multilingual Text To Speech in one MP3

This is a demonstration project of how to use mac OS's `say` plus [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/sox.html) to create an mp3 file that contains the spoken text from several files in various languages.

```bash
bash install.sh
bash generate.sh
```

A blog post explaining more about all of this is at https://soledadpenades.com/posts/2022/multilingual-text-to-speech

The text from the various files are taken from books and stories that I've read and liked. Since they're in the public domain you can also read them if you want to. Here are the links:

* Spanish: [Viernes Santo](https://gutenberg.org/files/40827/40827-h/40827-h.htm#Viernes_Santo) by Emilia de Pardo-Bazán
* English: [Night and Day](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/1245) by Virginia Woolf
* French: [Du côte de chez Swann](https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/2650) by Marcel Proust

Let me know if you make something cool with this technique!
